This project is a simple music player that was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The project contains songs that are royalty-free and the music player itself will display the artist who made the song.
I used the original cover arts for each song.

This music player can play a total of three songs, this number can be expanded very easily by just making a few small changes to the code (creating another song object and changing the total amount of songs).

I tried my best using OOP to write my code, but I ended up only using two objects. I know that I should've split the page into more objects, but it was easier this way.

Skills shown:

- Using webpack to manage files
- Using mp3-files on a website
- Using HTML and CSS to create a webpage
- Using JavaScript to make a webpage functional
